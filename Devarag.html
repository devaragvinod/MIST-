  <h1>WELCOME</h1>
  <h2>I am Devarag</h2>

  <p>
    My name is Devarag Vinod and I am a first year Computer Science and
    Engineering student at MIT Manipal. I am 19 years old. I actually have
    no idea of how many words I have to type so that this appears as a 
    paragraph (I am using the paragraph tag). I am interested in the Technical 
    and Web Development domain of MIST and am looking forward to working for 
    MIST.

    I am an avid sports follower. I play and watch cricket,
    football, badminton, volleyball, kabaddi and many more. I also like to 
    watch tennis now and then. I am crazy enough to follow even Olympic events 
    like shooting, javelin, archery, hockey, track and field events and so on.
